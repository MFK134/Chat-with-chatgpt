Project Description: A ReactJS-based chat application that allows users to communicate with ChatGPT and search for a certain word in the conversation history.

Installation: Clone the project from GitHub using the command git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git and run npm install to install the required dependencies.

Features: The chat app will have the following features:

Users can communicate with ChatGPT and receive responses to their messages.
Users can search for a certain word in the conversation history.
The chat app will display the search results and highlight the searched word in the conversation history.
Components: The chat app will have the following components:
App: This will be the main component that will render all other components.
ChatHistory: This will display the conversation history.
ChatInput: This will allow users to enter messages and communicate with ChatGPT.
SearchBar: This will allow users to enter a certain word to search for in the conversation history.
SearchResult: This will display the search results and highlight the searched word in the conversation history.
APIs: The chat app will use the OpenAI API to integrate ChatGPT and allow users to communicate with it.

Styling: The chat app will have a modern and clean design with a chat history on the left, chat input and search bar on the bottom, and search results on the right.

Data Flow: When a user enters a message in the ChatInput component, it will send a request to the OpenAI API to get a response from ChatGPT. The response will then be displayed in the ChatHistory component. When a user enters a certain word in the SearchBar component, it will search for that word in the conversation history and display the results in the SearchResult component.

Testing: The chat app can be tested using Jest and Enzyme to ensure that it properly communicates with ChatGPT and displays search results correctly.

Deployment: The chat app can be deployed on a web server using a cloud hosting service like AWS or Heroku.
